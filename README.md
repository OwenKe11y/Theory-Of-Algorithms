## Introduction
For the <b>45699 -- THEORY OF ALGORITHMS</b> module, a GitHub repository must be created that must contain the following content to a sufficent level:
 * Two Jupyter Notebooks which discuss:
   * Definition and explanation of the Post Correspondence Problem and a code example of a solution of the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem.
   * A demonstration of a Countdown numbers game utilising a functional programming language.

 * A comprehensive GitHub repository that conatins:
   * A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is
     in it, and how to run the notebooks.
   * Comprehensive commit history, with each commit representing a reasonable unit of work.
     
 The content of this introduction was taken directly from the project brief for ease of use and review purposes.

## Repository Content
This repository contains two comprehensive Jupyter Notebooks as well as all lab content pertaining to the module. These notebooks can be accessed via the methods [below](#running-the-notebooks)
